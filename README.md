# Hello DS - Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of crop and livestock production across different African countries. It includes interactive visualizations and geospatial analysis of agricultural production data. The project uses Jupyter Notebooks for data manipulation, visualization, and geographic mapping.

## Files Included

- **`ProductionAnalysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and visualizations.
- **`Production_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa.csv`**: The dataset used in the analysis containing crop and livestock production data for African countries.
- **Shapefiles (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`)**: Geographic data used for mapping and visualizations.

## Project Setup

To run the project locally or in an online environment like Binder, you will need the following Python packages:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting visualizations.
- **geopandas**: For geographic data handling and mapping.
- **jupyter**: To run the Jupyter notebook.

### Running on Binder
